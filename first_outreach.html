							<h3>Texas Robot Roundup</h3>
							<article class="box post">
								<p>
								The Texas Robot Round Up (TRR) is a off-season competition that was started by the ausTIN CANs (2158) in 2011. At first, the event was held at Anderson high school, and then as more and more teams wanted to compete, the event eventually moved to the Austin Convention Center during NI Week. Last year, UIL decided to become more involved in robotics and decided to create the UIL State Championships during NI week. Problematically, TRR was without a venue and Anderson high school was unable to host the event at their school. Hearing about this, Valor knew that there was only one course of action. Valor extended a helping hand and offered their high school facilities to the ausTIN CANs in order to keep the fun annual off-season event going.
								</p><p>
								Thus, we jointly held our very first FRC competition, at Vandegrift High School. As a rookie team this made for an amazing experience. We were able to learn how much time and effort FIRST volunteers and students put in to making an event. As a team preparing for the 2018 FRC season the event helped us get ready for the many rigors of competition.

							<h3>FTC Team Mentoring</h3>
							<article class="box post">
								<p>
								Valor spent the last 6 months before their build season helping 8 different FTC teams from the Viperbots program, as well as 2 other FTC teams from local middle schools. Each of the 10 FTC teams were assigned 1-3 FRC mentors to work with them for the majority of their design and build season. These 10 teams all compete in the FTC Alamo region and are able to feed directly into our FRC program. The students on Valor focus on teaching skills that will stay with the FTC students for the rest of their engineering and business careers. This mentor time is a great opportunity for the FTC students to learn from the years of experience that the member of valor have to offer. Not only do the members of valor help with the technical parts of the FTC teams, but also help plan and attend outreach events for them to plan and host.

							<h3>FTC Kickoff - Host</h3>
							<article class="box post">
								<p>
								Valor organized the FTC Central Texas Kickoff for a grand total of 36 teams to enjoy before the 2017-2018 Relic Recovery game was released. In the morning we ran our selected 10 team bonding games to serve as ice breakers and give all teams opportunity to meet others. Following suit, we ran 8 workshops for all rookie teams and rookie students so they could start their season off with a good foundation of knowledge for the FTC process and all it involves. These workshops included: Marketing Strategies/Business & Engineering Notebook, Hardware (Basic), Hardware (Advanced), and Programming (Java).

							<h3>FTC Regional Volunteers</h3>
							<article class="box post">
								<p>
								For the FTC Texas Alamo Regional, we set up arenas and judging rooms while also running the volunteer registration table the night before competition to ensure a steady event the following day. Additionally, we had several members volunteering until 9 pm that Friday night as Pit Admin and guides to get teams through the building. The day of competition, our team volunteered as pit queuers. This meant that we had people in all areas of the competition; some ran back and forth while others made sure that team were early for matches. By having members of Valor volunteer in addition to the loyal volunteers of FIRST events, the FTC Alamo Regional was able to run smoothly and according to schedule.
